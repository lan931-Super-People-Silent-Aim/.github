## 🔫 What Is Silent Aim in Super People?

**Silent Aim** is a type of aimbot that **doesn't adjust your camera view**. Instead, it silently redirects your bullets to hit your target, even if your crosshair isn’t perfectly aligned. The result? **Perfect shots** that look totally legit to spectators and killcams.

Perfect for stream-safe use or climbing ranked without triggering anti-cheat flags.
